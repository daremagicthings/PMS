- `authController.ts` — Added `changePasswordController` (PUT `/api/auth/password`).

- `authRoutes.ts` — New `PUT /password` route protected by `authMiddleware`.

- Mobile `AccountScreen.tsx` — Wired password change form to real API (`authApi.changePassword`), shows loading state and backend error messages.

- Mobile `api.ts` — Added auth token interceptor (reads from AsyncStorage), `authApi.changePassword()`.

- Web Admin `Account.tsx` — Password change form logins first to get JWT, then calls PUT `/auth/password`. Shows inline success/error feedback.

- Web Admin `api.ts` — Added auth token interceptor (reads from localStorage), `authApi.changePassword()`.



### API Verification Results

- `POST /api/invoices/:id/qpay` → Returns `qpayInvoiceId`, `qpayUrl`, QR Base64, 5 deep links ✅

- `POST /api/webhooks/qpay` → Marks invoice as PAID with `paidAt` timestamp ✅

- `PUT /api/auth/password` → Returns 401 without token (auth middleware works) ✅

- `tsc --noEmit` → Zero errors ✅



### Task 7.2 — Push Notifications (Expo)

- Added `expoPushToken` (String?) to `User` model. Migration `add_push_token` applied.

- Installed `expo-server-sdk` on backend.

- `pushNotificationService.ts` — `sendPushToUser()` and `sendPushToUsers()` using Expo push API. Silent skip for users without tokens, fire-and-forget pattern.

- `notificationService.ts` — `createNotification()` now auto-triggers `sendPushToUser()` after DB insert. All existing triggers (announcements, tickets, comments) get push for free.

- `userController.ts` — `updatePushTokenController` for `PUT /api/users/push-token` with Expo token format validation.

- `userService.ts` — `updatePushToken()` saves token to User record.

- `userRoutes.ts` — `PUT /push-token` route protected by `authMiddleware`.

- Mobile: Installed `expo-notifications`, `expo-device`, `expo-constants`.

- `usePushNotifications.ts` — Custom hook: requests permission, retrieves `ExpoPushToken`, sends to backend, handles foreground alerts, Android notification channel. Expo SDK 54 compatible.

- `App.tsx` — `usePushNotifications(!!token)` wired into `RootNavigator`.

- **Mobile App:** Created `PollsScreen.tsx` with elderly-friendly design: large radio-style option buttons (16px padding), progress bars for results (shown after voting), Mongolian labels. Added as 'Санал' tab in `TabNavigator.tsx`.



### Task 8.2 — E-Barimt (E-Receipt Mock Integration)

- **Database:** Added `ebarimtId`, `lotteryNumber`, `ebarimtQrCode` fields to `Invoice` model.

- **Backend:** `ebarimtService.ts` generates mock E-Barimt data (receipt ID, 8-digit lottery number, QR PNG as base64 via `qrcode` package). Hooked into `qpayService.processQpayWebhook()` as fire-and-forget auto-generation on payment. `GET /api/invoices/:id/ebarimt` endpoint added.

- **Mobile App:** Added `EbarimtData` type and `ebarimtApi.get()` to `api.ts`. HomeScreen now shows "Төлөгдсөн нэхэмжлэхүүд" (Paid Invoices) section with blue "🧾 И-Баримт" button. E-Barimt modal displays receipt ID, lottery number (🎰), amount, and QR code image.

## Phase 15: Advanced Admin Operations & Accounting (Part 1) — ✅ COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-02-26



### Task 15.1 — Expanded Unit Types (Parking & Storage)

- **Database:** Prisma schema configured with `PARKING` and `STORAGE` as `unitType` string values and a self-relation `parentApartmentId` linking `Apartment` to `Apartment`. Applied via `npx prisma db push`.

- **Backend:** Updated `apartmentService.getAllApartments` to fetch nested `parentApartment` and `childApartments`.

- **Web Admin:** Updated `Residents.tsx` UI to allow selecting `PARKING` (🚗 Граж) and `STORAGE` (📦 Агуулах). Conditionally rendered a parent apartment dropdown to establish the hierarchy directly from the UI. Displayed relation logic in the main table.



### Task 15.2 — Excel Import for Bulk Invoicing

- **Backend:** Installed `xlsx`. Implemented `invoiceService.bulkImportInvoices` which reads the spreadsheet, matches rows against the `Apartment` database table by building/entrance/unit mapping, and efficiently constructs `Invoice` entries. Created `POST /api/invoices/bulk-import` route linked to `multer`'s `uploadSingle`. Returns a `{successCount, errorCount, errors}` response.

- **Web Admin:** Completely revamped `Invoices.tsx` to include an "Import Excel" button. Uses a Modal + file dropzone UI, parses JSON via the frontend to generate a downloadable "Template" spreadsheet matching expected format, and surfaces real-time counts of imported/failed records.



### Task 15.3 — Bank Statement Reconciliation

- **Database:** `BankStatement` model established, mapping external bank deposits to `Invoice` records.

- **Backend:** `bankStatementService.ts` & `bankStatementController.ts` handling `POST /api/bank-statements/upload` (XLSX parsing), `POST /api/bank-statements/auto-match` (regex matching "Bldg-Unit" to pending invoices), and a manual match endpoint. Mounted in `routes/index.ts`.

- **Web Admin:** Built `/reconciliation` page with an intuitive Split-Screen layout. Left pane shows `PENDING` statements, right pane shows `PENDING` invoices. Integrated file upload, "Auto Match" functionality, and floating action bar for manual 1-to-1 matching and simultaneous invoice payment execution. Added to Sidebar.



### Task 15.6 — Advanced Invoice Management (Export & Filter)

- **Backend:** Updated `invoiceService.getAllInvoices` and `.getInvoicesForResident` to conditionally apply object filters (`status`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `apartmentId`) into Prisma's `whereClause`. 

- **Web Admin:** Modified Web Admin header in `Invoices.tsx` to include `status` select, 2 dynamic `date` pickers (Start/End Date range), and a local filter search by `unitSearch`. Data automatically re-fetches with a `300ms` debounce.

- **Web Admin:** Implemented frontend exporting by injecting the current filtered `Invoice[]` mapped object array into the `xlsx` library and converting to `.xlsx` sheets (i.e. 'Download to Excel').



### Task 15.4 & 15.5 — Detailed Transaction Transparency & PDF Export

- **Database:** Added `FinancialTransaction` model (date, amount, receiverSender, description, type: INCOME/EXPENSE) linked to `FinancialReport`. Migrated DB using `db push`.

- **Backend:** Implemented CRUD endpoints for transactions under `/api/financial-transactions`. Created `/api/financial-reports/:id/pdf` using `pdfkit` to stream formatted reports.

- **Web Admin:** Completely updated `Financials.tsx`. Added a slide-over Drawer that fetches and lists individual transactions for a selected month, allowing Admins to add/delete line items.

- **Mobile App:** Created `FinancialDetailScreen.tsx` with a transaction timeline list and a "Тайлан татах (PDF)" button. Integrated `expo-file-system` and `expo-sharing` for native download and sharing.

## Phase 16: Multi-Tenancy Database Migration � ? COMPLETED

**Date:** 2026-02-27



### Task 16.1 � Multi-Tenancy for Contacts & FAQs

- **Database:** Added `organizationId` to `Contact` and `Faq` models. Handled DB drift by pushing schema.

- **Backend:** Updated `contactService`, `contentService`, and their respective controllers to filter and save entries by the logged-in user's `organizationId`.

- **Reset:** All dummy data wiped using `npx prisma migrate reset` and migration history correctly synchronized with a clean slate.

## Phase 13: AI Chatbot � ? COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-02-27

### Task 13.1 � Gemini API Integration
- **Backend:** Installed `@google/genai`, built `aiService.ts` which injects DB Context (FAQs and Static Content for the user's organization) into a dynamic prompt. Exposed via `POST /api/ai/chat`.
- **Mobile App:** Created `ChatbotScreen.tsx` with a chat-like interface (messages, loading states). Accessible via a new Floating Action Button on the `HomeScreen`.



### Task 13.2 � Migrate from Gemini to Local Ollama
- **Backend:** Uninstalled `@google/genai` and switched `aiService.ts` to use `axios` to query a local Ollama instance (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`) using the `doomgrave/gemma3` model.



## Phase 17: Production Readiness & CI/CD — ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-02-27

### Task 17.1 — Security Hardening
- **Backend:** Installed helmet and express-rate-limit. Applied helmet and a general rate limiter to /api, and a strict rate limiter to /api/auth/login and /api/auth/password.

### Task 17.2 — Error Tracking (Sentry)
- **Backend:** Installed @sentry/node and @sentry/profiling-node, initialized Sentry at the top of server.ts, and added Sentry error handlers.
- **Mobile App:** Installed @sentry/react-native, initialized Sentry in App.tsx, and wrapped the root component.

### Task 17.3 — Database Indexing & Performance
- **Database:** Added @index to heavily queried Prisma fields (e.g., unitType, status, dueDate, apartmentId, organizationId) across various models (Apartment, Invoice, Ticket, Notification, FinancialTransaction, Contact, Faq) to optimize query performance.
- **Migration:** Created and ran migration 20260227074429_optimize_indexes.

### Task 17.4 — CI/CD Pipeline Setup
- **GitHub Actions:** Created .github/workflows/main.yml to automatically checkout the code, install dependencies, type-check the backend (	sc --noEmit), and type-check the web-admin. Runs on push and pull_request to the main branch.


### Phase 18: Deployment & DevOps — ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-02-27

### Task 18.1 — Backend Dockerfile
- **Backend:** Created `Dockerfile.prod` leveraging multi-stage/layer execution. Uses `node:20-alpine`, installs dependencies via `npm ci`, generates Prisma client, runs TS compiler, and runs migrations (`npx prisma migrate deploy`) prior to starting `node dist/server.js`.

### Task 18.2 — Web Admin Dockerfile
- **Web Admin:** Created `Dockerfile.prod` containing a two-stage build. First stage builds the React Vite app. Second stage uses `nginx:alpine` and copies over `dist` contents, loading a custom `nginx.conf` for React Router fallback support.

### Task 18.3 — Production Docker Compose
- **Infrastructure:** Created `docker-compose.prod.yml` at project root wrapping three services: `db` (Postgres 15), `backend`, and `web-admin`. Configured container networking, volumes for DB persistence, `.env` file passing, and restart policies.

### Task 18.4 — Mobile App EAS
- **Mobile App:** Created `eas.json` configuring standard Expo Application Services (EAS) build profiles for `development`, `preview`, and `production`. `production` is set to generate an `.aab` file for Android and an App Store compatible build for iOS.


## Phase 19: Branding & Polish — ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2026-02-28

### Task 19.1 — Global Logo Update
- **Assets:** Replaced all system logos with the new official branding (`icon.png`).
- **Web Admin:** Updated public icons and sidebar assets.
- **Mobile App:** Replaced app icon, splash screen, and favicon assets.

### Bugfixes
- **Backend:** Fixed broken images in Web Admin by configuring `helmet` to allow `cross-origin` resource policy for `/uploads`.
- **Mobile App:** Fixed announcement navigation. Tapping an announcement notification now correctly jumps to the "Мэдээ" tab and targets the "Зарлал" sub-tab using nested navigation.
- **Mobile App:** Installed missing `react-dom` and `react-native-web` dependencies to enable local web-based debugging and previewing.

### Bug Fixes (Session 2026-03-02)

- **Login Rate Limiter:** Increased backend authentication strictness from 5 to 100 max attempts for local development.
- **Web Admin Authentication Verification:** Updated Web Admin `Login.tsx` to process `SUPER_ADMIN` user types directly into the dashboard, fixing a lockout loop. Modified `User` interface to match.
- **Mobile App Connectivity:** Corrected the hardcoded `API_BASE_URL` from an old gateway to the actual local machine IP running the Docker container.
- **Ticket Submission Block:** Submitting tickets via the Mobile App failed due to a missing `apartmentId` on newly seeded test accounts. Scripted a direct linkage to an existing unit via the database.
- **Notification Deliverability (Web Admin):** Fixed `ticketController` and `commentController` so that `SUPER_ADMIN` accounts correctly receive real-time notifications, not just standard admins. Fixed Web Admin dashboard to target logs for the authenticated User instead of the first retrieved Admin.
- **Notification Deliverability (Mobile):** Added notification delivery hooks to the `castVoteController` for the digital voting system. Verified Mobile App push functionality requires standard `EAS` project keys in `app.json`.

### Bug Fixes (Session 2026-03-03)

- **Mobile App Poll Voting State:** Fixed an issue where the `PollsScreen` in the mobile app failed to process the backend `votes` array, causing polls that the user already voted on to appear as not voted. Updated `api.ts` to type the votes and `PollsScreen.tsx` to parse `opt.votes` into `votedPolls` and `selectedOptions` state upon fetching polls.
